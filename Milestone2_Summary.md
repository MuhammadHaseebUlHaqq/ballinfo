# LaLiga News Implementation - Milestone 2 Completed

## Frontend News Components Development

We've successfully completed the second milestone for the LaLiga news section implementation. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

### 1. Created Main News Components

- **NewsPage.jsx**: Main component to display all news articles with filtering and pagination
- **NewsCard.jsx**: Reusable component to display individual news articles in card format
- **NewsDetail.jsx**: Component for displaying the full details of a news article
- **NewsFilter.jsx**: Component for filtering news by categories and implementing search functionality
- **FeaturedNews.jsx**: Component that displays featured news on the homepage

### 2. Implemented News Service

- Created `newsService.js` in the services directory with the following functionality:
  - `getAllNews`: Fetches all news articles with pagination
  - `getNewsById`: Fetches a specific news article by ID
  - `getNewsByCategory`: Fetches news filtered by category
  - `getNewsByTeam`: Fetches news related to a specific team
  - `searchNews`: Searches for news articles by keyword
  - `getFeaturedNews`: Fetches featured news articles for the homepage

### 3. Added News Routing

- Updated `App.js` to include the following routes:
  - `/news` - Main news page
  - `/news/category/:category` - Category-filtered news
  - `/news/team/:teamId` - Team-specific news
  - `/news/article/:id` - News article detail page
  - Added search functionality through query parameters: `/news/search?query=keyword`

### 4. Designed and Styled News Components

- Created CSS files for each component:
  - `NewsPage.css` - Styling for the main news page
  - `NewsCard.css` - Styling for news article cards
  - `NewsDetail.css` - Styling for the detailed article view
  - `NewsFilter.css` - Styling for category filters and search
  - `FeaturedNews.css` - Styling for the featured news on homepage
- Implemented responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Matched the styling with the existing app's design language and theme

### 5. Implemented Featured News Section

- Shows the top 3-4 latest LaLiga news stories
- Added "View All News" link to navigate to the full news section
