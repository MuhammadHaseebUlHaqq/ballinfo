# LaLiga News Implementation - Milestone 1 Completed

## Backend Development & API Integration

We've successfully completed the first milestone for the LaLiga news section implementation. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

### 1. News API Integration

- Selected and implemented [News API](https://newsapi.org/) as our news data source
- Set up the API key and configured service utilities to fetch LaLiga news
- Implemented different API endpoints to fetch:
  - Top LaLiga headlines
  - Team-specific news
  - Category-based news
  - Search functionality

### 2. Database Schema

- Created a comprehensive MongoDB schema for news articles with fields for:
  - Title, content, and summary
  - Author information
  - Publication date
  - Source details
  - Image URL
  - Category classification
  - Tags
  - Related teams

### 3. API Endpoints

Implemented the following RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /api/news` - Get all news with pagination
- `GET /api/news/:id` - Get specific news article by ID
- `GET /api/news/category/:category` - Get news filtered by category
- `GET /api/news/team/:teamId` - Get team-specific news
- `GET /api/news/search?query=keyword` - Search news by keyword
- `POST /api/news/fetch/latest` - Trigger fetching latest news from external API
- `POST /api/news/fetch/team/:teamId` - Fetch team-specific news from external API

### 4. News Processing and Categorization

- Implemented intelligent news categorization based on content analysis
- Added automatic tagging of articles based on mentioned teams and topics
- Created mapping functions to transform external API responses to our schema
- Set up systems to avoid duplicate articles

### 5. Scheduled News Fetching

- Created a script that can be scheduled to periodically fetch fresh news
- Implemented functions to clean up old news (older than 30 days)
- Added team-specific news fetching capability

## Next Steps

With the backend foundation in place, we're now ready to move on to Milestone 2: Frontend News Components. This will involve:

1. Creating the UI components for displaying news
2. Implementing the frontend service to fetch news from our API
3. Adding news routing in the application
4. Designing and styling the news components
5. Creating a featured news section for the homepage
