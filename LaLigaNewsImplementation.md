# LaLiga News Section Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding a dedicated LaLiga news section to the football info web app. The plan is divided into three milestones to ensure a structured and manageable development process.

## Milestone 1: Backend Development & API Integration

**Objective**: Set up the news data API endpoints and integrate with external news sources.

### Tasks:

1. **Research and Select News API**:
   - Research available football news APIs (NewsAPI, Football-Data.org, etc.)
   - Choose one that provides good LaLiga coverage
   - Register for API key and set up authentication

2. **Create News Models and Schema**:
   - Create `News` schema with fields for:
     - Title
     - Content
     - Summary
     - Author
     - Publication date
     - Source
     - Image URL
     - Tags/categories
     - Related team/player references

3. **Implement News API Endpoints**:
   - Create `newsRoutes.js` with endpoints:
     - GET `/api/news` - Get all news articles (with pagination)
     - GET `/api/news/:id` - Get a specific news article
     - GET `/api/news/category/:category` - Filter news by category
     - GET `/api/news/team/:teamId` - Get team-specific news

4. **Build News Controller Logic**:
   - Create `newsController.js` with functions:
     - `getAllNews`: Fetch and paginate news articles
     - `getNewsById`: Fetch specific article by ID
     - `getNewsByCategory`: Filter news by category (transfers, match reports, etc.)
     - `getNewsByTeam`: Filter news by LaLiga team

5. **Implement API Fetching Service**:
   - Create scheduled jobs to fetch fresh news regularly
   - Implement data mapping from external API to our schema
   - Set up caching mechanism for API responses

## Milestone 2: Frontend News Components

**Objective**: Create the UI components required for the news section.

### Tasks:

1. **Create Main News Components**:
   - `NewsPage.jsx`: Main news page component
   - `NewsCard.jsx`: Reusable card for displaying news items
   - `NewsDetail.jsx`: Component for displaying full news article
   - `NewsFilter.jsx`: Component for filtering news by category/team

2. **Implement News Service**:
   - Create `newsService.js` in the `services` directory
   - Implement functions to call news API endpoints
   - Handle error states and loading states

3. **Add News Routing**:
   - Update `App.js` to add routes:
     - `/news` - News home page
     - `/news/:id` - News article detail page
     - `/news/category/:category` - Category-filtered news
     - `/news/team/:teamId` - Team-specific news

4. **Design and Style News Components**:
   - Create `News.css` styles for the news components
   - Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Match the existing app's design language and theme

5. **Implement Featured News Section for Homepage**:
   - Create `FeaturedNews.jsx` component for the homepage
   - Display top 3-4 LaLiga news stories
   - Add "View More" link to full news section

## Milestone 3: Enhanced Features & Optimization

   - Add comment section for logged-in users

4. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Implement lazy loading for news images
   - Add infinite scroll for news list
   - Optimize backend queries for performance

5. **Analytics and Testing**:
   - Add analytics tracking for news engagement
